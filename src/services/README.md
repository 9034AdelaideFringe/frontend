Implementing a Supabase Fallback Strategy
Based on your requirements, I'll analyze how to implement Supabase as a fallback database connection without affecting the current architecture. Let me break this down into a clear strategy.

Current Architecture Analysis
From your codebase:

Your React application currently connects to a backend API (via VITE_APP_API_URL)
You have various services (eventService.js, authService.js, etc.) that handle API calls
Your components consume these services to fetch and display data
Proposed Fallback Strategy
Rather than integrating Supabase throughout the application, we can create an abstraction layer that:

Automatically detects when the primary backend is unavailable
Transparently switches to Supabase as a fallback
Keeps the same API interface so components don't need to change
Design Considerations
1. Service Adapter Pattern
We can implement a service adapter pattern that:

Maintains the same function signatures as your current services
Internally routes requests to either your primary API or Supabase
Handles connection status monitoring and switching logic
2. Folder Structure
src/
  services/
    fallback/
      supabaseClient.js       # Supabase initialization 
      supabaseEventService.js # Supabase implementation of event service
      supabaseAuthService.js  # Supabase implementation of auth service
      ...
    serviceAdapter.js         # The adapter that switches between implementations
    eventService.js           # Your current service implementations
    authService.js            # Your current service implementations
    ...

    3. Connection Manager
We would need a connection manager that:

Periodically checks if the primary backend is available
Automatically switches to Supabase when it detects the primary backend is down
Attempts to reconnect to the primary backend periodically
Provides a status indicator (optional) to inform users when operating in fallback mode
4. Implementation Approach
Minimal Modification: Only serviceAdapter.js needs to be aware of both implementations
Transparent Operation: Components continue to import from serviceAdapter.js and don't need to know which backend is active
Feature Parity: The Supabase implementation should match the key functions of the primary backend
Potential Challenges
Data Synchronization: When switching between backends, data may be out of sync
Feature Parity: Ensuring Supabase has equivalent functionality to your primary backend
Authentication State: Managing authentication state across both systems
Next Steps
If this approach aligns with your needs, we can proceed to implement the following components:

A Supabase client setup file
Fallback implementations of your core services
A connection manager to handle the switching logic
The service adapter that routes requests to the appropriate backend
